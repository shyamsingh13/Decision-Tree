# Decision-Tree
As we know it is used for most of the classification problems so we have used this algorithm in some realtime dataset.
Here model typically looks like a tree with branches. I have performed this algorithms on mushroom Dataset. 

# 1. Mushroom Datasets

Abstract:

Mushroom hunting (otherwise known as "shrooming") is enjoying new peaks in
popularity. In this case study we will learn which features spell certain death and which
are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics.

Problem Statement:

Use decision tree algorithm to predict whether a mushroom sample is poisonous or
edible

Dataset Information:

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species
of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom.Each species is
identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not
recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide
clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom;
no rule like "leaflets three, let it be’’ for Poisonous Oak and Ivy

Scope:
● Exploring insights about the unfortunate trip from the existing data
● Data Pre-processing
● Training Decision Tree algorithms to predict the whether mushroom is edible or
poisonous
● Evaluating the model with various metrics like Accuracy, AUC ROC, Precision, etc.
and improve the score using statistical analysis over time

Learning Outcome:

Here I got a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each
other and build a decision tree classification model. Also you learn about various
performance measures of classification models and should be able to improve these
scores by taking the necessary step.

# For Practice -- 

Also will practice on various datasets but for that to get Idea 
about the dataset and model you need to refer to csv data and python file.
